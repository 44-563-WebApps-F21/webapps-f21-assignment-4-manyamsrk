    <h6 class="lordillingworth"><i class='fas fa-user'>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</i></h6><p class="speech"> Well, Rachel, what is over is over. All I have got to
    say now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy. The world
    will know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be
    something very near, and very dear. It is a curious thing, Rachel; my
    life seemed to be quite complete. It was not so. It lacked something,
    it lacked a son. I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.</p>

    <h6 class="mrsarbuthnot"><i class='fas fa-user'>MRS. ARBUTHNOT.</i></h6> <p class="speech">You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of
    him. The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.</p>

    <h6 class="lordillingworth"><i class='fas fa-user'>LORD ILLINGWORTH.</i></h6><p class="speech"> My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over
    twenty years. Why not let me have him for a little now? He is quite as
    much mine as yours.</p>
