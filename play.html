        LADY HUNSTANTON. Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?
        Miss Worsley is going to play. You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,
        won’t you? You don’t know what a treat is in store for you. [_To_
        DOCTOR BAUBENY.] I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to
        the rectory. I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the
        violin. Ah, I forgot. Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little
        defective, is it not?

        THE ARCHDEACON. Her deafness is a great privation to her. She can’t
        even hear my sermons now. She reads them at home. But she has many
        resources in herself, many resources.

        LADY HUNSTANTON. She reads a good deal, I suppose?

        THE ARCHDEACON. Just the very largest print. The eyesight is rapidly
        going. But she’s never morbid, never morbid.

        GERALD. [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.] Do speak to my mother, Lord
        Illingworth, before you go into the music-room. She seems to think,
        somehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.

        MRS. ALLONBY. Aren’t you coming?

        LORD ILLINGWORTH. In a few moments. Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot
        would allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join
        you later on.

        LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, of course. You will have a great deal to say to
        her, and she will have a great deal to thank you for. It is not every
        son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot. But I know you appreciate
        that, dear.

        LADY CAROLINE. John!

        LADY HUNSTANTON. Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord
        Illingworth. We can’t spare her.

        [_Exit following the other guests_. _Sound of violin heard from
        music-room_.]

        LORD ILLINGWORTH. So that is our son, Rachel! Well, I am very proud of
        him. He in a Harford, every inch of him. By the way, why Arbuthnot,
        Rachel?

        MRS. ARBUTHNOT. One name is as good as another, when one has no right to
        any name.

        LORD ILLINGWORTH. I suppose so—but why Gerald?

        MRS. ARBUTHNOT. After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.
