        <h6 class="ladyhunstantion"><i class='fas fa-user'> LADY HUNSTANTON.</i></h6><p class="speech">Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?
        Miss Worsley is going to play. You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,
        won’t you? You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.</p><p class="stage-direction"><i class="fas fa-directions" style="font-size:18px;"> [_To_
        DOCTOR BAUBENY.]</i></p><p class="speech">I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to
        the rectory. I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the
        violin. Ah, I forgot. Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little
        defective, is it not?</p>

        <h6 class="thearchdeacon"><i class='fas fa-user'> THE ARCHDEACON.</i></h6><p class="speech">Her deafness is a great privation to her. She can’t
        even hear my sermons now. She reads them at home. But she has many
        resources in herself, many resources.</p>

        <h6 class="ladyhunstantion"><i class='fas fa-user'> LADY HUNSTANTON.</i></h6> <p class="speech">She reads a good deal, I suppose?</p>

        <h6 class="thearchdeacon">THE ARCHDEACON.</h6><p class="speech"> Just the very largest print. The eyesight is rapidly
        going. But she’s never morbid, never morbid.</p>

        <h6 class="gerald"><i class='fas fa-user'> GERALD.</i></h6><p class="stage-direction"><i class="fas fa-directions" style="font-size:18px;">[_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.] </i></p><p class="speech">Do speak to my mother, Lord
        Illingworth, before you go into the music-room. She seems to think,
        somehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.</p>

        <h6 class="mrsallonby"><i class='fas fa-user'> MRS. ALLONBY.</i></h6><p class="speech"> Aren’t you coming?</p>

        <h6 class="lordillingworth"><i class='fas fa-user'> LORD ILLINGWORTH.</i></h6> <p class="speech">In a few moments. Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot
        would allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join
        you later on.</p>

        <h6 class="ladyhunstantion"><i class='fas fa-user'> LADY HUNSTANTON.</i></h6> <p class="speech">Ah, of course. You will have a great deal to say to
        her, and she will have a great deal to thank you for. It is not every
        son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot. But I know you appreciate
        that, dear.</p>

        <h6 class="ladycaroline"><i class='fas fa-user'> LADY CAROLINE.</h6></h6> <p class="speech">John!</p>

        <h6 class="ladyhunstantion"><i class='fas fa-user'> LADY HUNSTANTON.</i></h6><p class="speech"> Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord
        Illingworth. We can’t spare her.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction"><i class="fas fa-directions" style="font-size:18px;">[_Exit following the other guests_. _Sound of violin heard from
        music-room_.]</i></p>

        <h6 class="lordillingworth"><i class='fas fa-user'> LORD ILLINGWORTH.</i></h6> <p class="speech">So that is our son, Rachel! Well, I am very proud of
        him. He in a Harford, every inch of him. By the way, why Arbuthnot,
        Rachel?</p>

        <h6 class="mrsarbuthnot"><i class='fas fa-user'> MRS. ARBUTHNOT.</i></h6> <p class="speech">One cname is as good as another, when one has no right to
        any cname.</p>

        <h6 class="lordillingworth"><i class='fas fa-user'> LORD ILLINGWORTH.</i></h6><p class="speech">I suppose so—but why Gerald?</p>

        <h6 class="mrsarbuthnot"><i class='fas fa-user'> MRS. ARBUTHNOT.</i></h6> <p class="speech">After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.</p>
