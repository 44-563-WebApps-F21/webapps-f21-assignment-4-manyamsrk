                LADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?
                Miss Worsley is going to play.  You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,
                won’t you?  You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_
                DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to
                the rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the
                violin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little
                defective, is it not?

                THE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can’t
                even hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many
                resources in herself, many resources.

                LADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?

                THE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly
                going.  But she’s never morbid, never morbid.

                GERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord
                Illingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,
                somehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.

                MRS. ALLONBY.  Aren’t you coming?

                LORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot
                would allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join
                you later on.

                LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to
                her, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every
                son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate
                that, dear.

                LADY CAROLINE.  John!

                LADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord
                Illingworth.  We can’t spare her.
